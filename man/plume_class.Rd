\title{Calculate and return the plume optical class from eReefs model output..}
\usage{
plume_class(rsr)
}
\arguments{
\item{rsr}{A list of 2D vectors containing the reflectances at various wavelengths
     extracted from an EMS netcdf file:
rsr <- list(R_412, R_443, R_488, R_531, R_547, R_667, R_678)}
}
\value{
an array of the same size as R_412 containing values between 1 and 7 correspodning
        to optical plume classes.
}
\description{
Uses reflectance at multiple wavelengths from the model output to calculate plume colour
classes as defined by Devlin et al. (2012). Adapted from the Matlab function plume_detect.m 
by Mark Baird (CSIRO). This version by Barbara Robson (AIMS).
